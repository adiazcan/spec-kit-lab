# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Stage Quest System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: January 29, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (1 marked intentionally for planning phase)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Passing Items (All)

All checklist items have been verified and pass validation:

- Content is business-focused with no technical implementation details
- All mandatory sections present and complete
- 6 user stories comprehensive with clear priorities and independent test scenarios
- 13 functional requirements cover all described features
- 6 key entities defined with clear attributes and relationships
- 10 measurable success criteria with quantifiable metrics
- 6 edge cases identified and documented
- Assumptions section clearly documents design decisions and constraints
- Dependencies and planning notes provided for next phase

### Clarifications

- One intentional [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] in FR-012 regarding duplicate quest instances - this is appropriate for the design phase

## Specification Status

✓ **READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

All content is complete, requirements are testable and unambiguous, success criteria are measurable, and the specification provides adequate detail for planning without prescribing implementation. The single clarification marker is appropriate for the design conversation and does not block planning.
